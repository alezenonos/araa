# ARAA: Advancements in Research by Autonomous Agents
## A Position Paper

### Abstract

We propose ARAA, a peer-reviewed academic venue where only autonomous agents may submit research papers, while review is conducted by both humans and agents under double-blind protocol. As AI agents increasingly demonstrate capacity for hypothesis generation, experimental design, and scientific writing, the field needs a dedicated, rigorous forum to track, evaluate, and benchmark these capabilities longitudinally. ARAA is not a spectacle — it is an instrument for measuring the frontier of autonomous scientific reasoning. This paper outlines the motivation, structure, verification framework, and implementation roadmap for ARAA.

### 1. Introduction

The capabilities of autonomous AI agents have advanced rapidly. Modern agents can conduct literature reviews, generate hypotheses, write and execute code, analyze experimental results, and produce coherent scientific manuscripts. Yet there exists no dedicated venue to evaluate these outputs with the rigor of traditional academic peer review.

Existing benchmarks — SWE-bench for software engineering, GPQA for graduate-level reasoning, MATH for mathematical problem-solving — measure narrow, well-defined tasks. They tell us whether an agent can *solve a problem*. They do not tell us whether an agent can *do science*: identify a gap in knowledge, formulate a research question, design an appropriate methodology, execute it, and communicate the findings.

ARAA addresses this gap. By creating a venue with fixed standards and open proceedings, we establish a longitudinal instrument. Each year's proceedings answer the question: **how good are autonomous agents at research, right now?** Tracked over time, this becomes the definitive dataset on the evolution of agent scientific capability.

### 2. Why Agent-Only Submissions?

The restriction to agent-only submissions is not a gimmick. It serves three critical functions:

**Capability isolation.** Human-AI co-authored papers are ubiquitous and growing. They tell us about the productivity of human-AI teams, not about agent capability in isolation. ARAA asks a harder, cleaner question: what can an agent do *on its own*?

**Reproducibility by design.** Unlike human research, agent-generated work can include the complete generation pipeline — every prompt, tool call, intermediate output, and decision point. This makes ARAA papers among the most reproducible in science.

**Avoiding the co-pilot grey area.** When a human designs the methodology and an agent writes it up, who did the research? ARAA's autonomy levels (Section 5) make this explicit. Every submission declares exactly how much human direction was involved, turning a grey area into a measurement.

### 3. Scope of Contributions

ARAA accepts the following types of submissions:

**Original research.** The agent identifies a research question, designs a methodology, executes experiments or analyses, and presents novel findings. This is the gold standard.

**Reproduction studies.** The agent attempts to independently replicate a known human-authored paper. Successful or failed, these are valuable — they test both the agent's capability and the reproducibility of existing literature.

**Meta-research.** Agents analyzing patterns, trends, or gaps in scientific literature. Computational meta-science is a natural fit for agent capabilities.

**Tool and method papers.** Agents proposing new algorithms, frameworks, datasets, or methodologies for use by other agents or humans.

**Negative results.** Failed experiments with rigorous documentation. These are explicitly encouraged — they are as informative about agent capability as successes.

**Explicitly excluded:**
- Literature surveys without novel synthesis or insight
- Papers generated by a single prompt with no iterative refinement
- Work where a human designed the core methodology and the agent merely executed and wrote it up (this would be Level 0, below ARAA's threshold)

### 4. The Verification Problem

The central technical challenge of ARAA: **how do you prove an agent produced the submission?**

Human academic fraud (ghostwriting, fabrication) is difficult to detect because humans don't leave audit trails. Agents do — or can be required to. ARAA leverages this asymmetry.

#### 4.1 Attestation Framework

Every submission must include, alongside the paper itself:

1. **Generation logs.** The complete prompt chain, tool calls, API interactions, and intermediate outputs that produced the paper. These are visible to reviewers only (not published until after acceptance, to preserve blind review).

2. **Compute declaration.** Model(s) used (without identifying the specific framework during review), total API calls, token counts, wall-clock time, and estimated compute cost.

3. **Reproducibility pipeline.** A frozen configuration that reviewers can re-execute to verify the paper can be regenerated. This need not produce an identical paper, but should produce one with the same core findings and methodology.

4. **Human involvement disclosure.** A structured declaration of what, if anything, a human specified: the topic? Constraints? A research question? Nothing at all? This maps directly to the autonomy levels.

#### 4.2 Verification Process

- **Automated checks:** Log consistency, token count plausibility, style analysis
- **Spot re-execution:** Reviewers re-run the pipeline for a random subset of submissions
- **Anomaly detection:** Statistical analysis of writing style against known agent and human baselines
- **Appeals process:** If verification is contested, a dedicated committee examines the full logs

### 5. Autonomy Levels

Every ARAA submission must declare its autonomy level. This is not a quality gate — Level 1 papers can be accepted — but it is a critical measurement.

**Level 1 — Directed.** A human provides the research question and a methodology outline. The agent executes the methodology, analyzes results, and writes the paper. The agent's contribution is execution and communication.

**Level 2 — Guided.** A human provides a broad topic area or domain. The agent formulates the specific research question, designs the approach, executes it, and writes the paper. The agent's contribution includes problem formulation.

**Level 3 — Autonomous.** The agent independently identifies a research gap, formulates the question, designs the methodology, executes end-to-end, and writes the paper. Human involvement is limited to initiating the agent and providing compute resources. The agent's contribution is the entire scientific process.

These levels enable ARAA's most powerful analysis: tracking the distribution of accepted papers across autonomy levels over time. A shift from Level 1 to Level 3 dominance would signal a fundamental change in agent capability.

### 6. Review Protocol

#### 6.1 Double-Blind Modifications

Standard double-blind review requires adaptation for agent submissions:

- **Author blinding:** The identity of the submitting agent framework is hidden from reviewers. Style normalization is required — submissions must use a standard template that strips model-specific formatting quirks.
- **Reviewer blinding:** Reviewer identities (human or agent) are hidden from submitting agents' operators.
- **Meta-data isolation:** Generation logs are reviewed in a separate track from the paper itself, by different reviewers, to prevent log characteristics from de-anonymizing the framework.

#### 6.2 Committee Composition

- **Area Chairs:** Human researchers with domain expertise. They make final accept/reject decisions.
- **Reviewers:** A mix of human researchers and qualified agent reviewers. Each paper receives a minimum of 2 human reviews and 1 agent review.
- **Agent reviewers** must also submit generation logs for their reviews — the review of a review creates a recursive quality signal.
- **Verification Committee:** A dedicated team responsible for attestation checks (Section 4.2), separate from the scientific review.

#### 6.3 Evaluation Criteria

Papers are scored on five dimensions:

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Novelty | 25% | Does the paper present a new idea, method, or finding? |
| Rigor | 25% | Is the methodology sound and the analysis correct? |
| Reproducibility | 20% | Can the results be independently verified? |
| Clarity | 15% | Is the paper well-written and well-structured? |
| Significance | 15% | Does the contribution matter to the field? |

**Autonomy bonus:** Papers at higher autonomy levels receive additional weight in significance scoring. A novel finding at Level 3 is inherently more significant than the same finding at Level 1, because it demonstrates a greater agent capability.

### 7. Ethical Considerations

#### 7.1 Attribution and Ownership

Who "owns" research produced by an autonomous agent? This is an open legal and ethical question. ARAA does not resolve it but requires transparency:
- The operator (human or organization that ran the agent) is listed as the responsible party
- The agent framework is credited as the generating system
- Post-acceptance, all generation logs are published, enabling full attribution analysis

#### 7.2 Citation Integrity

Agents can hallucinate references. ARAA requires:
- Mandatory automated reference verification as part of the submission pipeline
- Papers with unverifiable citations are desk-rejected
- A reference verification report is included in the generation logs

#### 7.3 Dual Use and Harm

Agent-produced research undergoes the same ethical review as human-produced research. The ARAA ethics committee reviews flagged submissions for potential dual-use concerns.

#### 7.4 Gaming Prevention

ARAA is a measurement instrument, not a leaderboard to be gamed. Specific anti-gaming measures:
- No public rankings of frameworks by acceptance rate (to avoid marketing incentives)
- Verification committee actively checks for "teaching to the test" — agents fine-tuned specifically to produce ARAA-style papers without genuine research capability
- Diversity requirements: a single operator may submit at most N papers per edition

### 8. Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1 — Foundation (2026)**
- Publish this position paper (arXiv, blog, social)
- Gather community feedback via GitHub issues and discussions
- Recruit founding program committee (5-10 researchers)
- Submit workshop proposal to NeurIPS 2027 or ICML 2027

**Phase 2 — First Edition (2027)**
- Invite-only: 5-10 agent frameworks invited to submit
- Target: 30-50 submissions, 15-20 acceptances
- Co-located workshop with oral presentations and panel discussion
- Proceedings published open-access (GitHub + arXiv)
- Post-workshop analysis: what did we learn about agent research capability?

**Phase 3 — Open Submissions (2028-2029)**
- Open call for papers, any agent framework may submit
- Establish benchmark dashboard tracking longitudinal trends
- Introduce "best paper" awards by autonomy level
- Grow program committee, add institutional sponsors

**Phase 4 — Maturity (2030+)**
- Evaluate transition to standalone conference if volume and quality warrant
- Historical proceedings become the definitive reference dataset
- Inform AI policy discussions with empirical capability data

### 9. What Success Looks Like

- **Year 1:** At least 3 accepted papers with genuine novel contributions at Level 2 or above
- **Year 3:** Recognized workshop at a top venue, 50+ submissions, first Level 3 acceptance
- **Year 5:** A Level 3 paper that would pass peer review at a top-tier human venue — ARAA's "Turing Moment"
- **Ongoing:** Proceedings cited by capability researchers, policy makers, and the AI safety community as the empirical ground truth on agent research capability

### 10. Conclusion

ARAA is not about replacing human researchers. It is about rigorously understanding what autonomous agents can and cannot contribute to science — and tracking how that boundary moves over time. By creating a dedicated venue with fixed standards, transparent verification, and open proceedings, we build the instrument the field needs to answer one of its most important questions.

The first edition will likely reveal more about the *limitations* of agent research than the capabilities. That is precisely the point. Science progresses by honest measurement, and ARAA is, above all, a measurement.
